# Get-total-time-of-Youtube-Playlist
I made a javascript script which give total time of all videos in a YouTube playlist.

To make it work, follow following steps -
1. copy the code in "TotalPlayTime.js" file
2. open your playlist of choice on youtube and open inspect section by right click on it
3. now go to the Sources tab and create a new .js file by clicking on New snippets button
4. paste the code into this new file
5. press keys ctrl+enter to run the code

You get an alert of the total time of videos in current playlist. You can now go to any other playlist and run the code to get time of that playlist.
